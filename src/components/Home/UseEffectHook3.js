     Here <b> useEffect</b> accepts a function as itâ€™s first argument. This function handler will take care of any side effects you like when it gets run.

The function is a callback function after one of the React component lifecycle has been triggered.
      </p><br/>
      <h4>Probelm in this case :</h4>
      <p>The effect got triggered twice.

This behavior is not optimal, because if you have multiple effects or have new prop values being tossed from a parent component, it may trigger the effect multiple times.

This may cause inconsistency, weird side-effects, or freezing your app from an infinite loop. We will solve this problem in useEffectHook 4 </p>
